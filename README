Auratus is a very simple peer-to-peer chat client, written in Java, that I and 
a few friends wrote back in 2007. It's not very useful of itself, as there are
many better implementations out there. This was just a proof-of-concept and a
learning experience for me.

The basic structure is such:
- A server instance--run the ThreadedServer class--must be run on a computer
    with an IP address accessible to all clients. It will operate on port 3421
- Up to 10 client instances--run the Client class with the following options:
    - IP address of the server
    - Port number on the server (3421 by default)
    - Username for identification to all other clients

The bug database and planned features at the time we stopped development is
in the BUGS file.

Feel free to use it, play around with it, or whatever you want.
